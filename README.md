📝 Project Overview

Fraudulent medical insurance claims are a major challenge in the healthcare industry, leading to billions of dollars in losses every year. This project focuses on building a fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to identify suspicious claims and reduce the financial burden on healthcare providers.

The model analyzes structured claim data and predicts whether a claim is fraudulent or genuine, enabling proactive fraud prevention.

🚀 Features

Fraud Claim Detection: Classifies claims into fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares multiple ML algorithms for fraud detection.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix for model performance.

Dataset Handling: Works with real-world insurance claim datasets in .csv and .xlsx formats.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Handling → Pandas, NumPy

Visualization → Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning → Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression

Dataset Format: .csv, .xlsx

📂 Files in Repository

Out_of_time_data.csv → Out-of-time dataset for validation

claim_data_v1.csv → Primary dataset for training/testing

claim_data_v1.xlsx → Same dataset in Excel format

fraud.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

🔮 Future Scope

Integration with real-time claim processing systems.

Deployment as an API or web application.

Exploration of deep learning techniques (Neural Networks, Autoencoders).
